# 🚀 Rigour Vibe Quick Start Guide

Get started with rigorous development - from single-shot apps to complex features!

## 🎯 Choose Your Development Style

### 🏃‍♂️ Single-Shot App (4-8 hours total)
**For**: MVPs, prototypes, personal projects, learning experiments
**Goal**: Working app by end of day

### 🏗️ Feature Development (days to weeks)  
**For**: Production features, team projects, business requirements
**Goal**: Reliable, maintainable, well-tested features

### 🔧 Technical Problems (varies)
**For**: Bug fixes, performance issues, architecture changes
**Goal**: Root cause analysis and systematic solutions

---

## 🚀 Single-Shot App Workflow

**Perfect for building a complete app in one focused session**

### ⚡ Quick Setup (2 minutes)
Answer these 4 questions:
1. **What are you building?** (Be specific but concise)
2. **Who will use it?** (Primary user type)  
3. **What's the core action?** (Main thing users do)
4. **How will you know it works?** (Success criteria)

### Step 1: Lightning PRD (15-30 minutes)
```bash
@rvb-create-prd.mdc "Build a [your app idea]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Build a todo app with drag-and-drop priority ordering"
- "Build a expense tracker that categorizes spending automatically"  
- "Build a team standup bot that collects daily updates"

**AI will:**
- Ask 4-6 focused questions
- Auto-select Light Touch complexity
- Focus on 3-5 core features only
- Create: `../directives/prd/2025-07-09_prd_your-app.md`

### Step 2: Rapid Tasks (10 minutes)
```bash
@rvb-generate-tasks.mdc [reference your PRD file]
```

**AI creates:**
- 3-5 high-level tasks maximum
- 2-3 subtasks each
- Light testing requirements
- Waits for your "Go" to proceed

### Step 3: Focused Implementation (3-6 hours)
```bash
@rvb-process-tasks.mdc
```

**AI systematically:**
- Does one subtask at a time
- Waits for approval between subtasks
- Uses Light Touch quality gates (fast!)
- Tests core functionality only

### Step 4: Ship It (5 minutes)
```bash
@rvb-commit-message.mdc
```

**Total Time: 4-8 hours for a working app! 🎉**

## 🏗️ Feature Development Workflow

**For production features and team collaboration**

### 1. Choose Your Complexity Level ⚖️

**Answer these quick questions:**

#### A. Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Cosmetic changes, easy to fix if broken
- **Medium Risk:** Affects user workflows, moderate impact if broken  
- **High Risk:** Financial/security/data implications if broken

#### B. System Impact
- **Single Component:** Changes one file/component
- **Multiple Components:** Changes several related parts
- **Cross-System:** Integration across multiple systems

#### C. Timeline Pressure
- **Experimental:** Speed over perfection, prototype
- **Production:** Balanced approach, real feature
- **Mission-Critical:** Quality over speed, can't fail

**Your Level:**
- **Mostly Low + Single + Experimental = Light Touch (Level 1)**
- **Mix of Medium + Multiple + Production = Balanced Rigor (Level 2)**
- **Any High + Cross-System + Mission-Critical = Full Rigor (Level 3)**

### 2. Create Your PRD 📋

#### For Light Touch:
```bash
@rvb-create-prd.mdc "Feature: [Simple description]"
```

#### For Balanced/Full Rigor:
```bash
@rvb-create-prd.mdc "Feature: [Detailed description with risk factors]"
```

Creates: `../directives/prd/2025-07-09_prd_feature-name.md`

### 3. Generate Test-Aware Tasks 📝
```bash
@rvb-generate-tasks.mdc [reference your PRD file]
```

**AI creates:**
- High-level tasks based on complexity level
- Built-in test requirements
- Waits for your "Go" to generate detailed subtasks
- Creates: `../directives/tasks/2025-07-09_task_feature-name.md`

### 4. Implement with Tests First 🧪
```bash
@rvb-process-tasks.mdc
```

**OR for individual tasks:**
```bash
@rvb-implement-task.mdc
```

#### The Test-First Cycle:
1. **Red:** Write failing tests that describe what you want
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor:** Clean up code while keeping tests passing
4. **Verify:** Run full test suite to catch regressions
5. **Document:** Create test specs and implementation summaries

**Creates per task:**
- `../directives/tests/2025-07-09_test_feature-name_task-1-1.md`
- `../directives/summaries/2025-07-09_summary_feature-name_task-1-1.md`

---

## 🔧 Technical Problem Workflow

**For bugs, performance issues, and architecture changes**

### 1. Create Technical Specification 📋
```bash
@rvb-create-spec.mdc "Problem: [Description of technical issue]"
```

**AI will:**
- Ask technical investigation questions
- Perform root cause analysis (for bugs)
- Create detailed technical specification
- Creates: `../directives/spec/2025-07-09_spec_problem-name.md`

### 2. Generate Technical Tasks 📝
```bash
@rvb-generate-tasks.mdc [reference your Spec file]
```

### 3. Implement Solution 🔧
```bash
@rvb-process-tasks.mdc
```

**Focus on:**
- Root cause fixes
- Performance improvements
- System integration
- Technical verification

---

## 🚀 Example: Single-Shot Todo App

### Input:
```bash
@rvb-create-prd.mdc "Build a todo app with drag-and-drop priority ordering"
```

### AI Questions (quick answers):
1. **Platform?** → Web app
2. **Users?** → Individual users, personal use
3. **Core actions?** → Add todos, drag to reorder, mark complete
4. **Data persistence?** → Local storage
5. **Success criteria?** → Can manage daily tasks effectively

### Generated Tasks (auto Light Touch):
```
Task 1: Basic Todo CRUD
├── 1.1 Create todo input form
├── 1.2 Display todo list
├── 1.3 Mark todos complete/incomplete

Task 2: Drag-and-Drop Functionality

4. **Document** - Record decisions for future

## Success Patterns 🎯

### Daily Rhythm:
```
Morning: Run tests, plan current task
During: Write tests first, then implement
Evening: Verify no regressions, commit changes
```

### Weekly Rhythm:
```
Monday: Plan week's tasks and quality gate goals
Wednesday: Mid-week progress check and adjustments  
Friday: Quality gate verification and retrospective
```

### Task Completion:
```
1. Understand acceptance criteria
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement minimal solution
4. Refactor for quality
5. Verify all tests pass
6. Update documentation
7. Commit with clear message
8. Mark task complete
```

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### "Tests are taking too long to write"
- **Light Touch:** Focus on happy path + basic errors only
- **Balanced:** Add edge cases gradually as you discover them
- **Full Rigor:** Comprehensive upfront pays off in maintenance

### "Complexity keeps growing"
- Pause and reassess your level - you may need to upgrade
- Break current task into smaller pieces
- Add more test coverage for complex areas

### "Not sure what to test"
- Start with acceptance criteria from PRD
- Test the behavior users will see
- Add tests for error conditions
- Test integration points between components
