# Rule: Rigour Vibe Task Implementation

## Goal

To implement individual tasks using a test-first approach that ensures quality while maintaining development velocity. Each task must pass all tests before proceeding to the next.

## Implementation Protocol

### Pre-Implementation Checklist
Before starting any task:
- [ ] Identify current task from task list
- [ ] Review test requirements for this task
- [ ] Verify all previous tasks' tests are still passing
- [ ] Understand integration points with existing code

### Test-First Implementation Steps

1. **Red Phase: Write Failing Tests**
   - Write tests that describe the expected behavior
   - Verify tests fail for the right reasons
   - Ensure test coverage matches complexity level

2. **Green Phase: Make Tests Pass**
   - Implement minimal code to make tests pass
   - Focus on functionality over optimization
   - Verify all new tests pass

3. **Refactor Phase: Improve Code Quality**
   - Clean up implementation
   - Remove duplication
   - Improve readability and maintainability
   - Ensure tests still pass after refactoring

4. **Regression Phase: Verify Stability**
   - Run full test suite to ensure no existing functionality broken
   - Fix any regressions before proceeding
   - Update integration tests if needed

### Task Completion Protocol

A task is ONLY complete when:
1. ✅ **All required tests written and passing**
2. ✅ **Full regression test suite passes**
3. ✅ **Code quality standards met**
4. ✅ **Integration points verified**
5. ✅ **Task marked complete in task list**
6. ✅ **Changes committed with descriptive message**

### Complexity-Level Implementation

#### Light Touch Implementation
```
1. Write 1-2 core functionality tests
2. Implement basic functionality
3. Add basic error handling
4. Verify integration points work
5. Run smoke tests
```

#### Balanced Rigor Implementation
```
1. Write comprehensive unit tests (happy path + edge cases)
2. Add integration tests for key workflows
3. Implement functionality with proper error handling
4. Add logging/monitoring hooks
5. Performance check (if applicable)
6. Full test suite verification
```

#### Full Rigor Implementation
```
1. Write exhaustive test coverage (unit + integration + e2e)
2. Security consideration tests
3. Performance benchmark tests
4. Implement with defensive programming
5. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
6. Monitoring and alerting integration
7. Load testing (if applicable)
8. Full system verification
```

## Task Management

### Updating Task Lists
After completing each task:
1. Mark task as complete: `[ ]` → `[x]`
2. Update "Relevant Files" section with any new/modified files
3. Add any newly discovered tasks
4. Update test execution status

### Git Workflow
For each completed task:
```bash
# 1. Run tests to ensure everything passes
npm test  # or appropriate test command

# 2. Stage changes
git add .

# 3. Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: implement [task description]" \
           -m "- [specific change 1]" \
           -m "- [specific change 2]" \
           -m "- Tests: [test description]" \
           -m "Related to task [X.Y] in rvb-tasks-[feature].md"
```

### Parent Task Completion
When all subtasks under a parent task are complete:
1. ✅ Verify all subtask tests pass
2. ✅ Run integration tests for the parent task
3. ✅ Check quality gate requirements
4. ✅ Mark parent task complete
5. ✅ Commit parent task completion

## Error Handling and Recovery

### When Tests Fail
1. **Analyze the failure** - Understand why tests are failing
2. **Fix implementation** - Address the root cause
3. **Verify fix** - Ensure tests now pass
4. **Regression check** - Make sure no other tests broke
5. **Document** - If it was a complex issue, add comments

### When Regressions Occur
1. **Stop implementation** - Don't proceed until regressions are fixed
2. **Identify cause** - Use git diff to see what changed
3. **Fix regression** - Update code or tests as needed
4. **Verify solution** - Full test suite must pass
5. **Prevent recurrence** - Add tests to catch similar issues

### When Complexity Exceeds Expectations
If a task becomes more complex than anticipated:
1. **Pause implementation**
2. **Re-assess complexity level** - May need to upgrade rigor level
3. **Break down further** - Create subtasks if needed
4. **Add more tests** - Increase test coverage for complex areas
5. **Update task list** - Reflect new understanding

## Quality Verification Commands

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test path/to/test.spec.ts

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking (TypeScript)
npm run type-check

# Format check
npm run format:check

# Security audit
npm audit
```

## Progress Tracking

### After Each Task
Update the task list file with:
- Completed tasks marked `[x]`
- Any new files created/modified
- Test results summary
- Any blockers or issues discovered

### Quality Gate Verification
Before moving to next major section:
- [ ] All tasks in current section complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance within acceptable range
- [ ] Integration verified
- [ ] Documentation updated

## AI Instructions

When implementing tasks:

1. **Always start with tests** - Never write implementation code first
2. **One task at a time** - Complete fully before moving to next
3. **Verify regressions** - Always run full test suite
4. **Update documentation** - Keep task list current
5. **Commit frequently** - After each completed task
6. **Ask for guidance** - If complexity exceeds expectations
7. **Stop and wait** - Get user approval before proceeding to next task

### Interaction Pattern
1. Identify next task
2. Write tests for the task
3. Implement functionality
4. Verify all tests pass
5. Update task list
6. Commit changes
7. **Wait for user approval before continuing**

### Communication Format
